The aim of this project is to perform object tracking using optical flow. The optical flow between frames is estimated using a Pytorch implementation of FlowNet made by Clement Pinard. Then, the initial segmentation mask is propagated using the calculated flow to obtain a segmentation mask for each frame of the video. Both direct and sequential approaches are implemented.

A pre-trained model of FlowNet can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jbWiY1C_nqAUJRYZu7mwzV6CK7ugsa5v/view?usp=drive_link)
